# MilkyWayColourShow
Created in Visual Python, this program began as a working gravitational model of the Milky Way before the addition of coloured tails to each planet and the skewing of various orbits made for a colourful, lava lamp-esque display best suited for leaving on in the background while you work.

To run the program, simply run the .py file in VIDLE.

This software was written by E.J. Khouri in 2012.
